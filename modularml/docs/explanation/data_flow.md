# Data Flow

Detail how batches travel from :class:`~modularml.core.data.featureset.Featureset` objects through samplers, splitters, nodes, and losses.

## Outline

- Diagram the journey of `FeatureSet` instances feeding the execution context.
- Highlight checkpoints where transforms, samplers, and splitters intervene.
- Link to `how_to/create_featureset` and `how_to/custom_sampler` for hands-on steps.
