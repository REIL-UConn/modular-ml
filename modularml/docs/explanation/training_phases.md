# Training Phases

Explain how ModularML structures training into reusable phases (data prep, fitting, evaluation) and how schedulers orchestrate the flow.

## Outline

- Map each phase to the callbacks, samplers, and optimizers involved.
- Reference tutorials `03_multiple_featuresets` and `04_custom_training_phase` for real implementations.
- Show how-to links for `create_training_phase` and `use_callbacks`.
