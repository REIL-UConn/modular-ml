# Model Graph Design

Describe how :class:`~modularml.core.topology.model_node.ModelNode`, stages, and references work together to form complex graphs.

## Outline

- Principles for composing nodes (immutability, explicit references, reusable stages).
- Common graph patterns pulled from :doc:`../tutorials/02_multi_stage_model`.
- Guidance on debugging or visualizing graphs, with links to relevant how-to guides.
